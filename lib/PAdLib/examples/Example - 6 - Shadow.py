#The basic idea here is to draw the scene normally, and then multiply
#everything by another surface holding all the lighting information.

#So, for example, if the lighting surface is black, the scene will
#appear black.  If the lighting surface is white, the scene will
#appear its normal colors.  If the lighting surface is grey, the scene
#will appear its normal colors, but darkened.  In practice, the effect
#gives good results when the lighting surface is by default grey, but
#lighter grey or white in certain areas.  This makes the scene look
#dark in most places, but illuminated in others.

#The shadowing object returns a black and white mask and a location to
#draw it.  We could just blend this into the lighting surface, but one
#option below causes it to be first multiplied by a falloff surface.
#The mask becomes a greyscale intensity map.  It is then drawn into
#the lighting surface in the right place.  This adjusts the color of
#the lighting surface so as to be lighter grey or white in these
#places.

#The lighting surface is multiplied into the scene, completing the
#algorithm.
